## Risks & Recommendations (Static Discovery)

- Legacy .NET Framework 4.8 stack: limited support, security risks, and migration complexity.

- Hardcoded endpoints in config: risk if endpoints change or are exposed.
- No authentication/authorization logic found in sample (may be incomplete).
- Use of jQuery and AngularJS: outdated frontend frameworks, security and maintainability concerns.
- No external APIs detected in static scan.
