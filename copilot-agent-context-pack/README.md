# Copilot Agent Mode â€” .NET Discovery Context Pack
**Drop this folder into your repo (e.g., `/analysis/context/`) and point Copilot Agent Mode at it.**  
It contains checklists, templates, schemas, and prompts to standardize analysis of **ASP.NET MVC + jQuery/AngularJS** and **WCF/ASMX** solutions.

- Start with `instructions/AGENT_MODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Use `context/checklists/*` while scanning
- Emit reports following `context/schemas/*`
- See `prompts/*` to kick off or refine the analysis
